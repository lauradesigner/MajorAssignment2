                        <p>Daily physical activity stimulates various brain chemicals that may leave you feeling happier
                        and more relaxed. Daily activities sometimes leave you stressed, and one way to release it 
                        is by going to the gym or simply jogging around your neighborhood. You may also feel better
                        about yourself when you exercise regularly, which can boost your confidence.</p>

                        your sleep. Don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to go to sleep.</p>

                        decreases unhealthy triglycerides. Exercise significantly reduces your risk of cardiovascular
